**Local Lingust Server**

This is a back-end server application for the Local Linguist Android application.

Local Linguist is a mobile application for capturing linguistic data from remote locations where there is insufficient funding to research and document the local languages and dialects that exist. This has been developed on the Android platform to make it as widely available as possible.

Linguist is a web application designed to fulfil two primary goals:

* Consolidate the information uploaded from Local Linguist into a database that can be searched by linguists.

* Provide the facility for Linguists to define studies to be sent to the Local Linguist application for research.
